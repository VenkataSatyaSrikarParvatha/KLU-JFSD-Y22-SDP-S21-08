        <h1>About Project SAAHAS</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>SAAHAS</strong> stands for Support, Advocacy, Awareness, Health, Assistance, and Safety.
            It is an innovative web application designed to provide a safe and supportive environment for
            individuals experiencing domestic violence. This platform combines technology and social
            advocacy to ensure users receive critical resources, support, and legal assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
            SAAHAS empowers victims and survivors by giving them access to a network of counselors,
            legal advisors, and doctors. It also provides educational resources to raise awareness
            about domestic violence, helping to break the stigma around the issue. The project has been
            developed with a focus on usability, accessibility, and safety.
